# Tempest
Conducted an investigation from a workstation affected by a full attack chain.

## 1.Introduction
This project aims to introduce the process of analysing endpoint and network logs from a compromised asset. Given the artefacts, it will aim to uncover the incident from the Tempest machine. In this scenario, we will focus on handling and analysing the captured artefacts of a compromised machine.

## 2.Preparation - Log Analysis
### Log Analysis
Log analysis is the process of understanding events generated by a computer to identify anomalies such as security threats, application bugs, system performance, or other risks that may impact the organisation.
